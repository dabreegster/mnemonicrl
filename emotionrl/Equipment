<new Armour>
Name: Perl t-shirt
Desc: You had a white t-shirt imprinted with an image of a camel in Perl code
      quite some time ago. From then on, everybody recognized it as "the camel
      shirt." On the back proudly emblazoned is the Perl motto: There's more
      than one way to do it.

<new Weapon>
Name: laser tag gun
Desc: It appears to be a normal laser tag gun connected to no vest. It beeps,
      so it must be functioning. Thankfully there doesn't seem to be a fire
      button, so your thumb won't get worn out.

<new Weapon>
Name: rat flail
Desc: Wow... Is your friend influencing your dreams? Straight out of that comic
      he loves to read is a long chain with a splattered rat corpse on the end.
      The tip, consisting of a blackened rat tooth, seems to be sharp enough.

<new Weapon>
Name: trout
Desc: It's a trout! Like from mIRC! Though you use irssi these days, you can
      never resist a good ol' troutslap.

<new Weapon>
Name: walking staff
Desc: Hey, it's your old walking stick from when you used to camp! Just the
      right height for you, and it's even got that curious snake-shaped handle!

# Rank 1 Equipment (Tough)

<new Weapon>
Name: wheel of Fortuna
Desc: This curious vibrating disc almost seems to be alive. It quivers in your
      grip and seems to have a fond, boomerang-like attachment for you. Engraved
      upon its surface are medieval images depicting the fickle nature of Fate. 
      From time to time, you almost catch yourself hearing lines of Carl Orff's
      Carmina Burana from the direction of the disc.
Symbol: Blue /
Power: 2d15+8
Durability: 200

MaxMod: 9
Ranged: 1

<new Weapon>
Name: incense spear
Desc: It's a short stick... but the tip, though sharp, is glowing and spouting
      profuse amounts of smoke. You can smell many flavors: peppermint,
      lemongrass, frankincense, mur, and a minty one that reminds you of that
      time in the theatre with her... Anyway, though it's constantly burning,
      it doesn't seem to wear away at the stick, which is lucky because it
      looks like it could do a fair bit of damage if you could get it wedged
      into an enemy.
Symbol: Green /
Power: 8d5+5

<new Weapon>
Name: lava lamp sword
Desc: This is the most psychedelic blade you've ever seen! The base where the
      bulb usually is seems to function now as a handle. Globs of multicoloured
      stuff flow through it, rising to the tip, which seems to have been
      converted into a freakishly sharp point.
Symbol: Purple /
Power: 10d10+10
Durability: 300

MaxMod: 10

<new Weapon>
Name: strobe light gun
Desc: This small strobe light has been fitted with a comfortable handle. It's
      capable of rapidly pulsing up to 25 flashes per second! Better not stare
      into this thing for too long!
Symbol: white /

<new Armour>
Name: Isometric Boredom t-shirt
Desc: Your second custom-made shirt is black with a curious symbol and quote
      embedded: Isometric Boredom... It won't last. What is Isometric Boredom?
      You believe it to be the "long dark teatime of the soul," that horrible
      duration in which despair prevailed.

# Rank 0 Equipment (Never generated)

<new Amulet>
Name: magic peace talisman
Desc: You found this little magic stone at a New Age shop a few weeks ago.
      Since then, its message of "World Peace" has kept you company every hour
      as your first lucky charm. Squeezing it always did seem to help you to
      make calm, balanced decisions. Perhaps here it could allow you to channel
      something more!

<new Helmet>
Name: crown of thorns
Desc: Really, the time leading up to the breakup was the worst. The constant
      pressure to against your judgements, the confusion about your best
      friend flirting with her, and of course the constant nagging agony of
      worry. Suffer.
