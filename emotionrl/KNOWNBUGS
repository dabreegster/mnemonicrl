This is a partial list of some of the more noticable bugs that I intend to
remedy soon. Please report anything else you notice, especially errors in the
log.

If a bug actually halts your game, just try again and kindly report the bug so
I can fix it.

- Generating a new dungeon sometimes fails in the population stage because the
  generator runs out of hotspots. I think.
- The AI sucks. Especially movement.
- "Your the weapon strikes foo!" isn't exactly correct.
- It is possible to be trapped in the maze or open area, but this rarely
  happens.
- The game is horribly unbalanced.
- Many of my awesome ideas haven't been implemented yet.
- Animations for ranged attacks aren't yet implemented.
- If you shove a baddie with Tears of Rage and it smacks into another baddie...
  either it'll kill it or an infinite loop will be spawned, depending on
  whether the first can hurt the second.
- Populations of monsters and items are not distributed levelly throughout
  levels.
- Symbols for things are completely unintuitive. Sorry.
- Most dungeons have many dead-ends. More connectivity is needed.
- Attack order is wacky. Failed attempts don't deduct TP, the laughing block
  kicks in too late...
- Summoned code bugs just sort of sit there.
