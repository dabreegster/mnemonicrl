  - Form should be able to space better
  - popup cut off my shit!! freehand mode msg in map editor
  - table pad to max len of win? how to stretch? percentages?
  - per app keymap and stuff
  - factor out search, highlight
  - util::hook cant help ui keymaps, those're a queue


- hexed::map's target needs to say 'press _ to loop thru' but where? how does it know that
  exists in the UI?
- i've simplified roll's input
- resizing is wonky
** i want custom keyhandler in tmp choose!
- document flags for stuff, especially tmp popup/choose/askfor
- JMD keymap needs to work different now.. but when does <ENTER> mean ok and when
  change_song? what mode?


- resizing is ENTIRELY buggy
- cant use some keys well in searching/popups, etc. want to scroll!
- leading whitespace (or any?) and color tags screw up in wrap
- wheres keymap go?
- temporary stuff still gets a bit clobbered on resize
- call main->draw better.. frames per second thing on animated places? names = slow
- define automatic window behavior (like switching between "tabs" each with their own
  keymap... so switch between game, chat, popups.. move em, type, whatever)
- cant have "custom keys" in choose()
- HexedUI's _stop  calls "clear" command nonportably
- ^C causes asap shutdown.. shouldnt it trigger stop or something?

- snow
  - multi-tile snowflakes
  - 'wind' by nuking choosernd(-1, 1) in snowspawn
