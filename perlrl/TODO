  - </> in color tags, handle it in the higher level Msg sayer or something.

  - adjacnet tiles and other vector stuff is.. eh, needs to be in map info, so we can do
    bounds checkin

  - LOTS of toys.. trees, lamps, chandelier, fountain, literally anything i dont feel
    replicating

  - wall traps lag bad when there are lots.. hmm

  - conveyor belt
    - onscreen trigerring

  - animated river
    - spawning everywhere
    - sometimes we have to move down/up
    - direction switching and color
  - animated fountains

  - sign feature. maybe even cheesy animated


  - need for multiple ID counters..
  - clean _Data, watch what we store there. no objects.
  - stairs.. test both modes, static and random maps.

  - better FOV configuration, per map and per player...
    - colored light
      - animated/fading in and out all niftyily..
    - static objects giving it off


  - mapeditor
    - spawn/feature broken
    - stair editor
  - tutorial level
  - in singleplayer, death happens twice. in multiplayer, crashes :p
  - flood flipped out in multiplayer? aargh


  ** underwater / island
  - snake that splits up where you hit it.. gotta force it to run into itsefl


  - sort targetlist by distance? maybe
  - server logging (but safe, in tmp!)
  - dont be lazy about client message logging
  - mrl_log is overwritten before a client stores it, oops :p
  - away banner? :P server should log last few chats and send

  - cyphen/uben switch quickly in standalone borks

  - invmv and spawnstuff and all that should be autocalled when we make something in a
    certain context...
  - reorganize effects much more cleanly..
  - the pre/before debate for east -> go
  - put join/leave netcode in BDSM::Map's join/quit bit with a callback?
  - nuke UI, PLAYER, GAME->server/client to see if stuff REALLY works :p
  - the map hookshot draw stuff is in debate, try it with sprites and other stuff to see.
    main issue is camera order, focus before draw
  - turnbased/realtime overhaul, and lag() in both.
  - SEVERE escape key lag.


- start fixing major things
  - content management, scripting, online editing..
    - piecemeal cyphen objects..
  - BDSM fixin
    - layer system FTW

- organize static content code better. scripts for cyphen-uben especially


  - general idea from the mechanics separation.. still have actions go to the same place,
    but maybe have an Item module that puts character code handling items all in the same
    place.. task-oriented, not who-does-it-oriented


  - finish turnbased system
    - paralyed effect, firing weapon
    - fix numbers
    - a timeout

  - homes (hotel!)
    - choose top/bottom?
    - when one is made, send new map to residents in there now
  - doors (with real lighting)

[bugs]
 - in instructions, press key is now wrong ;)

  - autoreconnect
    - ... update the updater :P
    - ship src with Curses.pm built with panels

  - didnt fix targeting ;;

  - fugly crap all in Sky.. you can get out of elevators, for one thing

[features]
  - collab exploration/adv/puzzle game, screw numbers

  - start party code.. sharing experience, who's in, individ dungeons

  - namebanner for damage

  - monster behaviors

  - dnd style RPs. partybased, events (monsters entering room, flooding)
  - laggy players = AI

[bdsm]
- proper vectors finally?

- blobs need much work. leaving a blob. callbacks not happening. etc
  - efficient blob blitting.. blob moving vs something in blob moving
  - move while train mooves, glitchy
- Sprite warps in naughty ' ' places.. bugs in general
- static should be called "Scenery"
- rework entire blit override bit, combine all the BDSM things
  - like, Animated uses floatingblit. ew!
- how to move entire blob from within blob?
- try colliding an agent INSIDE a sprite. chain pushing.
- animated/sprite is a bad order!
- sprites take up extra pad space!
- a way to color sprites. use editor like for map?

- std config for dungeon gen stuff

- map editor improvements. region?

- switch Blockmap back to exporting methods to Map; no multi-algorithm strategy pattern
- Blockmap's backup and general strategy could use polish

[obj / game]
- blocking stairs.. monsters do it if you run. some sort of swap system?

- dungeonspawner/joining causes lag cause server is in a tight loop. threads?

- peoples accounts, savign stuff.. but first figure out modes of play
- server generates a few maps when not loaded down (can do that for parties later)

- AI stops chasing if you stay still for GiveUp seconds... cheating
- cool explosions if rm dirs in adj_tiles for floodfillr
- for now, attacking players is allowed by projectile since thats intended penalty..
- identify system
- anti cheating: check legal go() moves
- universal turn counter, or else tracking nearest thing to ya is impossible
- 3D dungeons
  - light rendering; the code was screwing up other stuff so i nuked it
  - bridges
  - going up there / proper map structure
  *** render with the new Z-layer system
- mess with opengl again.. find a good menuing library. i mean.
